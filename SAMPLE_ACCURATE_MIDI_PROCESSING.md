# True Sample-Accurate MIDI Processing Enhancement

## Overview

This enhancement adds true sample-accurate MIDI message processing to the XG Synthesizer, enabling precise timing control down to individual audio samples. This addresses the limitation in the previous implementation where MIDI messages were only processed at audio block boundaries.

## Key Improvements

### 1. True Sample-Level Timing Precision
- **Previous**: MIDI messages processed only at audio block boundaries (every 512-960 samples)
- **New**: MIDI messages processed at exact sample positions within blocks
- **Precision**: Down to 20.83Î¼s at 48kHz sample rate (single sample resolution)

### 2. Enhanced API with Backward Compatibility
- **New Method**: `send_midi_message_at_sample()` for sample-accurate message sending
- **New Method**: `generate_audio_block_sample_accurate()` for sample-accurate audio generation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing methods unchanged
- **Seamless Migration**: Existing code works without modification

### 3. Advanced Message Processing Features
- **Precise Timestamping**: Messages processed at their exact temporal positions
- **Out-of-Order Handling**: Messages automatically sorted by time for proper sequencing
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk message handling with `send_midi_message_block()`
- **Mixed Message Support**: Simultaneous processing of regular MIDI and SYSEX messages

### 4. Robust Implementation
- **Thread-Safe**: Proper locking mechanisms for concurrent access
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized buffering and garbage collection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and graceful degradation
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Thorough testing of boundary conditions and corner cases

## Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture Changes

1. **Enhanced Constructor**:
```python
def __init__(self, sample_rate: int = DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE, 
             block_size: int = DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE,
             max_polyphony: int = DEFAULT_MAX_POLYPHONY):
    # Added sample-accurate processing fields
    self._message_heap: List[Tuple[float, int, int, int, int]] = []  # (time, priority, status, data1, data2)
    self._sysex_heap: List[Tuple[float, int, List[int]]] = []  # (time, priority, data)
    self._current_time: float = 0.0  # Current time in seconds for buffered mode
    self._block_start_time: float = 0.0  # Time at start of current audio block
    self._sample_times: List[float] = []  # Timestamps for each sample in block
    self._message_priority_counter: int = 0  # Counter for unique message identification
```

2. **New Sample-Accurate Processing Method**:
```python
def generate_audio_block_sample_accurate(self, block_size: Optional[int] = None) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Generates audio blocks with sample-accurate MIDI message processing.
    Messages are processed at their exact sample positions within blocks.
    """
```

3. **Per-Sample Message Processing**:
```python
def _generate_audio_block_sample_accurate(self, block_size: int) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Generates audio block with sample-accurate message processing.
    Each sample is processed individually with temporal message checking.
    """
```

4. **Temporal Message Dispatch**:
```python
def _process_messages_at_time(self, sample_time: float):
    """
    Processes all MIDI messages whose time has arrived by specified sample time.
    Ensures messages are handled at their exact temporal positions.
    """
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Heap-Based Message Buffering**:
   - Uses `heapq` for efficient message sorting and retrieval
   - Maintains temporal order with unique priorities for stable sorting
   - O(log n) insertion and O(1) retrieval for optimal performance

2. **Sample-Time Precomputation**:
   - Precomputes timestamps for all samples in block for efficiency
   - Avoids repeated time calculations during sample processing
   - Reduces computational overhead during audio generation

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Efficient buffer clearing after message processing
   - Minimal memory footprint for timestamp arrays
   - Proper garbage collection of processed messages

## Usage Examples

### Sample-Accurate Processing (Recommended)
```python
# Create synthesizer
synth = XGSynthesizer(sample_rate=48000, block_size=960)

# Send precisely timed messages
synth.send_midi_message_at_sample(0x90, 60, 100, 100)  # Note On at sample 100
synth.send_midi_message_at_sample(0x80, 60, 64, 200)   # Note Off at sample 200

# Generate audio with sample-accurate processing
left_channel, right_channel = synth.generate_audio_block_sample_accurate(960)
```

### Traditional Block-Boundary Processing (Backward Compatible)
```python
# Create synthesizer
synth = XGSynthesizer(sample_rate=44100, block_size=512)

# Send timed messages
synth.send_midi_message_at_time(0x90, 60, 100, 0.005)
synth.send_midi_message_at_time(0x80, 60, 64, 0.015)

# Generate audio with traditional processing
left_channel, right_channel = synth.generate_audio_block(512)
```

### Batch Message Processing
```python
# Create a musical phrase with precise timing
phrase = [
    # (sample_position, status, data1, data2)
    (0,   0x90, 60, 100),  # C4 Note On at start of block
    (100, 0x90, 64, 90),   # E4 Note On at sample 100
    (200, 0x80, 60, 64),   # C4 Note Off at sample 200
    (300, 0x80, 64, 64),   # E4 Note Off at sample 300
    (400, 0x90, 67, 95),   # G4 Note On at sample 400
    (500, 0x80, 67, 64),   # G4 Note Off at sample 500
]

# Send all messages in batch
for sample_pos, status, data1, data2 in phrase:
    synth.send_midi_message_at_sample(status, data1, data2, sample_pos)

# Generate audio with sample-accurate processing
left, right = synth.generate_audio_block_sample_accurate(960)
```
