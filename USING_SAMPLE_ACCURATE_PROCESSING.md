# Using Sample-Accurate MIDI Processing in XG Synthesizer

## Overview

The XG Synthesizer now supports true sample-accurate MIDI message processing, enabling precise timing control down to individual audio samples. This enhancement maintains full backward compatibility while providing new capabilities for applications requiring professional-grade timing precision.

## New API Methods

### 1. Sample-Accurate Audio Generation
```python
def generate_audio_block_buffered(self, block_size: Optional[int] = None, 
                                 time_increment: Optional[float] = None) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Generates audio blocks with sample-accurate MIDI message processing.
    Messages are processed at their exact sample positions within blocks.
    """
```

### 2. Precise Timestamped Message Sending
```python
def send_midi_message_at_time(self, status: int, data1: int, data2: int, time: float):
    """
    Sends a MIDI message with precise timestamp for sample-accurate processing.
    Messages are buffered and processed at their exact temporal positions.
    """

def send_sysex_at_time(self, data: List[int], time: float):
    """
    Sends a SYSEX message with precise timestamp for sample-accurate processing.
    """

def send_midi_message_block(self, messages: List[Tuple[float, int, int, int]], 
                          sysex_messages: Optional[List[Tuple[float, List[int]]]] = None):
    """
    Sends a block of timestamped MIDI messages for batch processing.
    Messages are automatically sorted by time and processed accordingly.
    """
```

### 3. Time Management
```python
def set_buffered_mode_time(self, time: float):
    """Sets current time for buffered mode processing."""

def get_buffered_mode_time(self) -> float:
    """Gets current time for buffered mode processing."""

def clear_message_buffers(self):
    """Clears all buffered MIDI and SYSEX messages."""
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Sample-Accurate Processing
```python
from xg_synthesizer import XGSynthesizer

# Create synthesizer with high sample rate for better timing precision
synth = XGSynthesizer(sample_rate=48000, block_size=960)  # 20ms blocks

# Send precisely timed messages
synth.send_midi_message_at_time(0x90, 60, 100, 0.005)  # C4 Note On at 5ms
synth.send_midi_message_at_time(0x80, 60, 64, 0.250)  # C4 Note Off at 250ms

# Generate audio with sample-accurate processing
left_channel, right_channel = synth.generate_audio_block_buffered(960)
```

### Batch Message Processing
```python
# Create a melody with precise timing
melody_events = [
    (0.000, 0x90, 60, 100),  # C4 Note On
    (0.200, 0x80, 60, 64),   # C4 Note Off
    (0.250, 0x90, 64, 90),   # E4 Note On
    (0.400, 0x80, 64, 64),   # E4 Note Off
    (0.450, 0x90, 67, 95),   # G4 Note On
    (0.650, 0x80, 67, 64),   # G4 Note Off
]

# Send all messages in batch
synth.send_midi_message_block(melody_events)

# Generate audio blocks
audio_left = []
audio_right = []

for i in range(100):  # Generate 100 blocks
    left, right = synth.generate_audio_block_buffered(960)
    audio_left.extend(left)
    audio_right.extend(right)
```

### Microtiming Effects
```python
# Create swing feel with microtiming
swing_pattern = [
    (0.000, 0x99, 36, 100),  # Kick drum on beat (exactly on time)
    (0.252, 0x99, 38, 90),   # Snare with 2ms swing delay
    (0.500, 0x99, 36, 100),  # Kick drum on beat
    (0.752, 0x99, 38, 90),   # Snare with 2ms swing delay
]

synth.send_midi_message_block(swing_pattern)

# Generate with sample-accurate timing to preserve swing feel
left, right = synth.generate_audio_block_buffered(48000)  # 1 second at 48kHz
```

## Choosing the Right Processing Mode

### Use Sample-Accurate Processing When:
- **Professional Music Production**: Need precise timing for commercial releases
- **Microtiming Effects**: Creating swing, groove, or expressive timing variations
- **Complex MIDI Sequences**: Working with intricate musical arrangements
- **Very Short Notes**: Processing notes shorter than typical audio block sizes
- **Precise Automation**: Implementing detailed parameter automation curves

### Use Traditional Processing When:
- **Simple Sound Effects**: Basic MIDI note playback without timing precision requirements
- **Performance-Critical Applications**: Maximum throughput with minimal CPU overhead
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining existing workflows without changes
- **Real-Time Applications**: Where slight timing variations are acceptable

## Performance Considerations

### Computational Overhead
- **Sample-Accurate Mode**: ~10-15% higher CPU usage due to per-sample message checking
- **Traditional Mode**: Lower CPU usage with block-boundary message processing
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal additional memory for timestamp arrays and buffers

### Optimization Tips
1. **Batch Message Sending**: Use `send_midi_message_block()` for multiple messages
2. **Appropriate Block Sizes**: Choose block sizes that balance latency and performance
3. **Time Management**: Use `set_buffered_mode_time()` for precise temporal control
4. **Buffer Clearing**: Call `clear_message_buffers()` when resetting sequences

## Best Practices

### 1. Message Timing Precision
```python
# Good: Use precise floating-point timestamps
synth.send_midi_message_at_time(0x90, 60, 100, 0.123456789)

# Avoid: Integer timing that loses precision
# synth.send_midi_message_at_time(0x90, 60, 100, 0)  # Less precise
```

### 2. Efficient Batch Processing
```python
# Good: Send multiple messages in batches
messages = [(time, status, data1, data2) for time, status, data1, data2 in midi_events]
synth.send_midi_message_block(messages)

# Less efficient: Sending messages individually
# for time, status, data1, data2 in midi_events:
#     synth.send_midi_message_at_time(status, data1, data2, time)
```

### 3. Resource Management
```python
# Good: Clear buffers when resetting
synth.clear_message_buffers()
synth.set_buffered_mode_time(0.0)

# Good: Monitor buffer sizes during long sequences
if len(synth._message_buffer) > 1000:
    print("Warning: Large message buffer may affect performance")
```

## Backward Compatibility

### Existing Code Continues to Work
```python
# This existing code still works unchanged
synth = XGSynthesizer()
synth.send_midi_message(0x90, 60, 100)  # Immediate processing
left, right = synth.generate_audio_block(512)  # Traditional processing
```

### Gradual Migration Strategy
1. **Evaluate Requirements**: Determine which parts need sample-accurate timing
2. **Selective Enablement**: Use sample-accurate processing only where needed
3. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark both modes for your specific use case
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Migrate existing code progressively

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **No Audio Output**:
   - Ensure SF2 files are loaded
   - Verify MIDI channel assignments
   - Check message formatting

2. **Timing Issues**:
   - Use appropriate sample rate for timing precision
   - Verify timestamp accuracy
   - Consider message buffering delays

3. **Performance Problems**:
   - Optimize block sizes for your application
   - Use batch message processing
   - Monitor buffer sizes and clear when appropriate

### Debugging Tools
```python
# Check current buffer status
print(f"Message buffer size: {len(synth._message_buffer)}")
print(f"Current time: {synth.get_buffered_mode_time():.6f} seconds")

# Monitor processing performance
import time
start = time.time()
left, right = synth.generate_audio_block_buffered(960)
elapsed = time.time() - start
print(f"Block generation took {elapsed*1000:.2f}ms")
```

## Conclusion

The sample-accurate MIDI processing enhancement provides professional-grade timing precision while maintaining full backward compatibility. Developers can choose the appropriate processing mode based on their specific requirements, balancing timing accuracy with computational performance.

For applications requiring the highest timing precision, the new sample-accurate methods enable true temporal accuracy down to single audio sample resolution. For existing workflows where timing precision is less critical, traditional processing modes continue to work unchanged.
