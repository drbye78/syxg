# XG Synthesizer - Refactored Channel-Based Implementation

## Overview

This is a refactored version of the XG Synthesizer that uses a channel-based architecture instead of the original note-based approach. The refactoring improves efficiency by using persistent channel renderers instead of creating new objects for each note.

## Key Changes

### Original Implementation
- `XGToneGenerator` was instantiated for every note played
- Each instance handled a single note with specific parameters
- Inefficient due to frequent object creation and destruction

### Refactored Implementation
- `XGChannelRenderer` is a persistent per-channel renderer (16 total)
- Each renderer handles all MIDI messages for its specific channel
- Internal management of multiple active notes
- Significantly reduced object creation overhead

## Files

- `refactored_tg.py`: Contains the new `XGChannelRenderer` and `ChannelNote` classes
- `refactored_xg_synthesizer.py`: Updated synthesizer that uses the new channel renderers
- `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`: Detailed explanation of the refactoring process
- `FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: Summary of the refactored implementation

## Usage

The refactored implementation maintains API compatibility with the original:

```python
from refactored_xg_synthesizer import XGSynthesizer

# Create synthesizer
synth = XGSynthesizer(sample_rate=48000, block_size=960)

# Send MIDI messages
synth.send_midi_message(0x90, 60, 100)  # Note On: C4, velocity 100 on channel 1
synth.send_midi_message(0x80, 60, 64)   # Note Off: C4, velocity 64 on channel 1

# Generate audio
left_channel, right_channel = synth.generate_audio_block(960)
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Reduced object creation and memory allocation
2. **Better Resource Management**: Persistent channel renderers instead of per-note generators
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Better separation of concerns between channel and note processing
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify codebase
5. **Extensibility**: Simpler to add new channel-level features

## Compatibility

The refactored implementation maintains full compatibility with:
- MIDI XG standard
- Existing API
- SF2 file handling
- Effect processing
- All MIDI message types

## Testing

To test the implementation:

```bash
python test_refactored_synth.py
```

## Integration

To integrate with existing projects:
1. Replace imports of `XGSynthesizer` with `refactored_xg_synthesizer.XGSynthesizer`
2. Ensure all dependencies are available
3. Test with existing MIDI sequences

## Future Work

1. Performance benchmarking against original implementation
2. Comprehensive testing with complex MIDI files
3. Documentation updates
4. Integration with existing projects
