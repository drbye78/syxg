# SF2 SoundFont Refactoring Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Automatic Parsing of Preset Instruments
- Added `_parse_preset_instruments()` method that automatically parses all instruments used by a preset
- Modified `_parse_pdta_presets_selective()` to call this method after parsing preset data
- This ensures that when a preset is parsed, all its associated instruments are also parsed automatically

### 2. Caching Subchunk Sizes
- Added `chunk_sizes` dictionary to store subchunk sizes alongside positions
- Modified `_locate_pdta_subchunks()` to cache both positions and sizes of mandatory subchunks
- Updated selective parsing methods to use cached sizes instead of re-reading subchunk headers

### 3. Removed Unneeded File Pointer Operations
- Eliminated save/restore file pointer operations in selective parsing methods
- Using cached chunk sizes eliminates the need to re-read subchunk headers
- Simplified the parsing logic by removing try/finally blocks for file position restoration

## Key Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: 
   - Eliminates redundant file operations
   - Reduces file I/O by caching subchunk sizes
   - Automatic instrument parsing reduces future I/O operations

2. **Simplified Code**:
   - Removed complex file pointer save/restore logic
   - Cleaner, more maintainable parsing methods
   - Better separation of concerns

3. **Enhanced Functionality**:
   - Automatic parsing of all instruments used by a preset
   - More complete data loading during on-demand parsing
   - Better integration between presets and their instruments

## Technical Details

### New Data Structures
```python
self.chunk_sizes = {}  # Stores subchunk sizes for quick access
```

### Enhanced Methods
- `_locate_pdta_subchunks()`: Now caches both positions and sizes
- `_parse_pdta_presets_selective()`: Uses cached sizes and auto-parses instruments
- `_parse_pdta_instruments_selective()`: Uses cached sizes and removes file pointer operations
- `_parse_preset_instruments()`: New method for automatic instrument parsing

### Performance Improvements
- No more redundant subchunk header reads
- Eliminated file position save/restore operations
- Automatic instrument parsing prevents future I/O for the same data
