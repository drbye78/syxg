# XG Synthesizer Sample-Accurate MIDI Processing Enhancement

## Overview

This enhancement adds true sample-accurate MIDI message processing to the XG Synthesizer, enabling precise timing control down to individual audio samples. This addresses the limitation in the previous implementation where MIDI messages were only processed at audio block boundaries.

## Key Improvements

### 1. True Sample-Level Timing Precision
- **Previous**: MIDI messages processed only at audio block boundaries (every 512-960 samples)
- **New**: MIDI messages processed at exact sample positions within audio blocks
- **Precision**: Down to 20.83Î¼s at 48kHz sample rate (1/48000 seconds)

### 2. Enhanced Audio Block Generation
- **New Method**: `generate_audio_block_buffered()` with sample-accurate processing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `generate_audio_block()` method unchanged
- **Temporal Accuracy**: Messages processed at their exact temporal positions

### 3. Improved Message Buffer Management
- **Precise Timestamps**: Messages stored with sub-block timing information
- **Accurate Sorting**: Messages processed in correct temporal order regardless of receipt order
- **Sample-Time Mapping**: Each audio sample has an exact temporal reference

## Technical Implementation

### Core Changes

#### 1. Enhanced Constructor
```python
def __init__(self, sample_rate: int = DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE, 
             block_size: int = DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE,
             max_polyphony: int = DEFAULT_MAX_POLYPHONY):
    # Added sample-accurate processing fields
    self._block_start_time: float = 0.0  # Time at start of current block
    self._sample_times: List[float] = []  # Timestamps for each sample
```

#### 2. New Sample-Accurate Processing Method
```python
def generate_audio_block_buffered(self, block_size: Optional[int] = None, 
                                 time_increment: Optional[float] = None) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Generates audio blocks with sample-accurate MIDI message processing.
    Messages are processed at their exact sample positions within blocks.
    """
```

#### 3. Sample-Level Message Processing
```python
def _generate_audio_block_sample_accurate(self, block_size: int) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Generates audio block with sample-accurate message processing.
    Each sample is processed individually with temporal message checking.
    """
```

#### 4. Temporal Message Dispatch
```python
def _process_messages_at_time(self, sample_time: float):
    """
    Processes all MIDI messages whose time has arrived by the specified sample time.
    Ensures messages are handled at their exact temporal positions.
    """
```

## Usage Examples

### Sample-Accurate Processing (Recommended)
```python
# Create synthesizer
synth = XGSynthesizer(sample_rate=48000, block_size=960)

# Send precisely timed messages
synth.send_midi_message_at_time(0x90, 60, 100, 0.005)  # Note On at 5ms
synth.send_midi_message_at_time(0x80, 60, 64, 0.015)   # Note Off at 15ms

# Generate audio with sample-accurate processing
left_channel, right_channel = synth.generate_audio_block_buffered(960)
```

### Traditional Block-Boundary Processing (Backward Compatible)
```python
# Create synthesizer
synth = XGSynthesizer(sample_rate=44100, block_size=512)

# Send timed messages
synth.send_midi_message_at_time(0x90, 60, 100, 0.005)
synth.send_midi_message_at_time(0x80, 60, 64, 0.015)

# Generate audio with traditional processing
left_channel, right_channel = synth.generate_audio_block(512)
```

## Benefits
