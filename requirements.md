# Requirements for XG Synthesizer

## Python Version
- Python 3.7 or higher

## Required Packages
- numpy>=1.19.0
- pygame>=2.0.0 (for MIDI I/O examples)

## Optional Packages
- scipy (for advanced audio processing)
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- sounddevice (for real-time audio I/O)

## System Requirements

### Minimum
- CPU: 1 GHz processor
- RAM: 512 MB
- Storage: 100 MB free space for core application
- Additional storage for SF2 files (typically 50-500 MB per file)

### Recommended
- CPU: Multi-core processor (2+ GHz)
- RAM: 2 GB or more
- Storage: SSD for faster SF2 loading
- Audio interface with low latency support (for real-time applications)

## Audio Hardware
- Sound card or audio interface capable of playback at configured sample rate
- MIDI interface (USB, DIN, or virtual) for MIDI input (optional)

## SF2 File Support
The synthesizer supports:
- Standard SoundFont 2.0 (.sf2) files
- Multiple concurrent SF2 files
- Bank remapping
- Preset blacklisting
- Sample caching for performance

## Operating Systems
- Windows 7 or higher
- macOS 10.12 or higher
- Linux (most distributions with Python support)

## Development Environment
For development and modification:
- Python IDE (PyCharm, VS Code, etc.)
- Git for version control
- pytest for running unit tests (if added later)

## Integration Capabilities
The synthesizer can be integrated with:
- Real-time audio applications
- MIDI sequencers
- Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)
- Educational software
- Game audio engines
- Web applications (with appropriate wrappers)

## Performance Targets
- Latency: <10ms for real-time applications (depends on hardware and buffer settings)
- Polyphony: Configurable up to system limits
- Sample Rates: 22050 Hz to 192000 Hz (standard rates)
- Block Sizes: 32 to 8192 samples (configurable)

## Memory Usage
- Base memory: ~50 MB
- Per SF2 file: Variable (typically 10-100 MB depending on complexity)
- Sample cache: Configurable (default ~200 MB)
- Total memory: Depends on loaded SF2 files and cache settings

## Network Requirements
- No internet connection required for basic operation
- Internet access needed only for downloading additional SF2 files
