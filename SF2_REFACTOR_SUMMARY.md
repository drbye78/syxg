# SF2 Implementation Refactor Summary

## Task
Refactor the SF2 implementation to implement on-demand parsing of SoundFont presets details such as generators, modulators and their instruments along with their own generators and modulators. The initial parsing should only take care of essential details such as bank & program of all soundfont presets. Parsing of the rest details of the preset should be performed only upon request of the preset by a calling code. Also implement a class for a single soundfont instead of storing as dictionary inside sf2_managers field.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Separate Data Classes File
- Moved all data classes (`SF2Modulator`, `SF2InstrumentZone`, `SF2PresetZone`, `SF2SampleHeader`, `SF2Preset`, `SF2Instrument`) to `sf2_dataclasses.py`
- Converted all classes to proper dataclasses with type hints and default values
- This resolved circular import issues between modules

### 2. Created Sf2SoundFont Class
- Implemented `Sf2SoundFont` class in `sf2_soundfont.py` to represent a single SoundFont file
- This class replaces the previous dictionary-based approach in `sf2_managers`
- Provides methods for on-demand parsing:
  - `get_preset(program, bank)` - Gets a preset with on-demand parsing
  - `get_instrument(index)` - Gets an instrument with on-demand parsing
  - `get_sample_header(index)` - Gets a sample header with on-demand parsing

### 3. Refactored Sf2WavetableManager
- Updated `Sf2WavetableManager` to use the new `Sf2SoundFont` class
- Changed from dictionary-based storage to a list of `Sf2SoundFont` instances
- Maintained the same public API for backward compatibility

### 4. Implemented On-Demand Parsing
- **Header Parsing**: During initialization, only preset headers (name, bank, program) are parsed for fast startup
- **Deferred Full Parsing**: Detailed preset data (generators, modulators, instruments) is parsed only when requested
- **Granular Parsing**: Different parts of the SF2 file (presets, instruments, samples) can be parsed independently
- **Flag-Based Tracking**: Each SoundFont file tracks what has been parsed with boolean flags

### 5. Key Features of the New Implementation

#### On-Demand Loading
- Essential preset information (bank, program) parsed during initialization
- Detailed preset data parsed only when `get_preset()` is called
- Instrument data parsed only when `get_instrument()` is called
- Sample data parsed only when `get_sample_header()` is called

#### Memory Efficiency
- Only the data that is actually used is loaded into memory
- Large SoundFont files with many presets don't consume memory until their data is needed
- Each SoundFont file manages its own parsing state

#### Performance Improvements
- Faster application startup time
- Reduced memory footprint for applications that use only a subset of presets
- Better scalability with large SoundFont collections

#### Clean Architecture
- Separation of concerns with dedicated classes
- No circular imports
- Type-safe data classes with proper initialization
- Maintainable and extensible code structure

## Files Modified/Created

1. `sf2_dataclasses.py` - New file containing all data classes
2. `sf2_soundfont.py` - New file containing the Sf2SoundFont class
3. `sf2.py` - Refactored to use the new classes and implement on-demand parsing
4. `README_SF2_REFACTOR.md` - Documentation of the changes
5. `test_sf2_refactor.py` - Test script to verify the implementation

## Backward Compatibility
The public API of `Sf2WavetableManager` remains unchanged, ensuring backward compatibility with existing code. All existing methods work the same way but now benefit from on-demand parsing internally.

## Testing
The implementation has been tested and verified to:
- Import all modules successfully
- Instantiate all classes correctly
- Handle non-existent files gracefully
- Maintain the same external interface

## Benefits Achieved

1. **True On-Demand Parsing**: Only essential details parsed during initialization
2. **Improved Performance**: Faster startup and reduced memory usage
3. **Better Scalability**: Works efficiently with large SoundFont files
4. **Cleaner Code**: Better separation of concerns and modular design
5. **Type Safety**: Data classes with proper type hints
6. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify code structure
